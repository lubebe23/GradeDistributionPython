# Sem2Final Project

This project was a submission for a hackathon where my group and I were met with the below problem statement.

The main objectives of the project were to upload a csv file and manipulate the data using python. For this we implemented the data into an array using the Pandas library.
The file consisted of a list of student names and ID's which we had to sort by order of last name. We then had to take a group of students and search for the five highest achievers
to be sorted by grade. After this we had to showcase the performance on a graph along with the time complexity of the sorting and searching algorithms used.
